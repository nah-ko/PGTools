PGTools
=======

This is mainly to have a Docker_ container that provides tools for
PostgreSQL_ that everyone could use simply.

Some of them are packaged and listed by PGDG_ community.
For now, only pgCluu_ and pgBadger_ are installed that way in this container.

What's coming next: adding some others that are not packaged
